# mcimport
# a fork of the original 'mcimport' for the MineClone2 subgame.

This fork of mcimport converts a Minecraft world into Minetest; specifically a MineClone2 subgame.

## Notes

Compatible with Minecraft Worlds up to & including v1.12.2

This is a WIP; so the conversion list is continually being refined for more accurate conversions.

##### Coordinate Conversion from Minecraft to Minetest:
```
X = Approximately the same in both.
Y = Approximately -64 nodes in MCL2
Z = The number is approximately inverted.

Example:
Minecraft: -1457,4,-1632
Minetest-MineClone2: -1439,-60,1647
```

## MineClone 2 Info: 
* [Wuzzy's MineClone2 Sub-game forum link](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=16407)
* [Wuzzy's MineClone2 Repo](http://repo.or.cz/MineClone/MineClone2.git)

--------------------------------------------------
The process is offline. Minecraft should not be running on the world
that is to be converted. The output should be an empty folder, and
no map.sqlite should be present in the empty folder.

The output is a world folder that is playable, permitted that you're using the MineClone2 sub-game.
This is a WIP, so you may still encounter "Unknown" blocks in the Minetest world.

This mcimport fork was created to improve on the existing mcimport
project, with one significant change: This form aims to create
*playable* minetest worlds where stuff works:

- chests can be used to put stuff in
- doors open and close
- simple mesecons circuits may work
- furnaces work

Also, the assumption is that converted maps are for multiplayer
use, and that the most important motivation for using this
converter is to *preserve* previously custom built objects
and buildings, but *not* meant to preserve the gameplay style
and feel of minecraft. This project aims to never convert
blocks to "Unknown" nodes and strives to leave a playable are
that is friendly for users performing a one-time conversion.

- some flowers are approximations
- double plants may end up being single node blocks
- until fixed, fences, walls & other items are likely broken


There are a large number of things that are just never going to
be convertable, and so the following will likely never work and
are therefore converted to air blocks. Entities are readily
spawned by several mob mods in minetest, so conversion is likely
not critical to users, and left out.
